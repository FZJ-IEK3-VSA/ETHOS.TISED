# ETHOS.TISED


TISED (TIme SEries Downscaler) is part of [ETHOS (Energy Transformation Pathway Optimization Suite)](https://go.fzj.de/ethos_suite) as a Python library for global downscaling of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) from one hour resolution to one minute for energy system applications. The package utilizes the non-dimensionalization of solar irradiance and time with statistical parameters matching to increase the temporal resolution of GHI.

## Working Principle
* Collection and Preparation of Input Parameters
* Extraction of Defining Parameters from Low-Resolution Data
* Matching Algorithm
* Selection of High-Resolution Data
* Unpacking the 1 Minute Data

## Getting Started
The package is continually developed. However, for the current use, the ghi.ipynb file in the Example folder for Milan (Lat.: 45.50, Lon.: 9.16) 2017 location can be accessed. The complete database is uploaded on [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15226264)

## About Us

We are the [Methodology laboratory](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ice/ice-2/research-1/integrated-scenarios/methodology-lab) department at the [Institute of Energy and Climate Research: Jülich Systems Analysis (ICE-2)](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ice/ice-2), belonging to the Forschungszentrum Jülich. Our interdisciplinary department's research is focusing on energy-related process and systems analyses. Data searches and system simulations are used to determine energy and mass balances, as well as to evaluate performance, emissions and costs of energy systems. The results are used for performing comparative assessment studies between the various systems. Our current priorities include the development of energy strategies, in accordance with the German Federal Government’s greenhouse gas reduction targets, by designing new infrastructures for sustainable and secure energy supply chains and by conducting cost analysis studies for integrating new technologies into future energy market frameworks.
